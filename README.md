# Hi Idiots!
Are you tired of reading back through all your notes to create a study guide? Everybody already knows you use AI for everything, so put that Claude subscription to use and combine all of your lecture slides into a single pdf!

## THIS ENTIRE PROJECT IS IN PROGRESS! MORE TO COME

Here are all the tools included in this stupid idea I had.

### Unlocker

Why are some files even locked to begin with like why? Batch print to pdf with this tool! Only works if you have printing permissions I think. Might add a feature where if printing is disabled it just takes a screenshot or something idk.

### Combiner

Don't waste your project memory, and make it difficult to organize everything. Just combine it into one pdf with this tool! Not really exciting to be honest though.
