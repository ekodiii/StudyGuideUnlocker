# Hi Idiots!
Are you tired of reading back through all your notes to create a study guide? Everybody already knows you use AI for everything, so put that Claude subscription to use and combine all of your lecture slides into a single pdf!

## THIS ENTIRE PROJECT IS IN PROGRESS! MORE TO COME

Here are all the tools included in this stupid idea I had.

### Unlocker

Why are some files even locked to begin with like why? Batch print to pdf with this tool! Only works if you have printing permissions I think. Might add a feature where if printing is disabled it just takes a screenshot or something I don't know yet.

### Combiner

Don't waste your project memory, and make it difficult to organize everything. Just combine it into one pdf with this tool! Not really exciting to be honest though.

### Converter

What are you actually going to do with a 80mb .pptx? Be so for real right now. Who even cares if its not .pdf! Make almost anything a .pdf with this app that definetly won't work because it requires so many workaround permissions and downloaded software! I hope you have Powerpoint installed because this will NOT work without it. Also needs AppleScript permissions on Mac, so don't hold any hopes up that it will work perfectly.
